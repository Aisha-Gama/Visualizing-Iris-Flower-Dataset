# Visualizing-Iris-Flower-Dataset
## Overview

This project visualizes and analyzes the famous Iris Flower dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species:
- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

Each sample has measurements for the following features:
1. **Sepal Length**
2. **Sepal Width**
3. **Petal Length**
4. **Petal Width**
5. **Species** (Target class)

## Dataset Description

- The dataset contains **150 samples** equally divided across the three species.
- Each row corresponds to a sample, with the measurements of the four features and the species label.

## Columns

- `Id`: Index of the flower sample
- `Sepal Length`: Length of the sepal in centimeters
- `Sepal Width`: Width of the sepal in centimeters
- `Petal Length`: Length of the petal in centimeters
- `Petal Width`: Width of the petal in centimeters
- `Species`: The type of iris flower (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

## Analysis Summary

Based on the analysis of the Iris dataset:
- **Iris-setosa** is easily distinguishable from the other species, primarily due to its smaller sepal and petal sizes.
- **Iris-versicolor** and **Iris-virginica** have more similarities and show some overlap in their feature measurements. However, **Iris-virginica** has the largest petal sizes, while **Iris-versicolor** tends to have larger sepals.
- The species are more difficult to separate when based solely on sepal length and width.
- **Petal length** and **petal width** appear to be the most informative features for classification.

## Conclusion

This visualization project demonstrates that while the Iris species have distinctive features, there are overlaps in some of the measurements, especially between Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica. **Petal length** and **petal width** are the most effective features for distinguishing between species.

## Tools Used
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data visualization and analysis.
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.
